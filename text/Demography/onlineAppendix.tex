%%%%%%%%% Data Appendix 
\section{Data Appendix-MxFLS}\label{mxfls}
 
 
 In order to examine potential mechanisms through which the reform may have affected fertility and maternal mortality, we use longitudinal data on contraceptive use and knowledge from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS). The MxFLS is a nationally representative longitudinal dataset that follows individuals over time, covering various topics regarding the well-being of the Mexican population including information on reproductive health. This survey was conducted during three waves in 2002-2003, 2005-2006 and 2009-2012. The data between the years when the survey was conducted is generated by linear interpolation. The sample used for our analysis consists of women aged 15-44 who completed the reproductive health questionnaire resulting in a total of 15,114 individuals. Table~\ref{MXFLS} in the appendix presents descriptive statistics. Modern contraceptives are condoms, oral or/injectable/implants of hormones preventing ovulation, IUD, sterilization and emergency contraception. Traditional or less safe methods are calendar method or rhythm method, coitus interrupts, herbs or teas. For a detailed account of modern and traditional methods, see for instance WHO: \url{http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs351/en/}.

% Data on contraceptive use and knowledge among adult and teenage women are obtained from the Mexico National Health Survey (ENSA) conducted in 2000 and the Mexican National Survey of Health and Nutrition (ENSANUT) conducted in 2006 and 2012. This data is a nationally representative household survey of repeated cross sections, covering various topics regarding nutrition and health, including information on reproductive health. This survey was conducted in 2000, 2006 and 2012 and covers 45,870, 48,304 and 50,000 households per wave respectively. The data between the years when the survey was conducted is generated by linear interpolation. The sample used for constructing the state level contraceptive control variables, consists of women aged 15-44 who completed the reproductive health questionnaire.

  			The table displays exposure to the reform at time of conception for birth and maternal deaths respectively. The abortion law was passed on 24 April 2007. In terms of fertility outcome, the full effect of the reform will be observed in January 2008 since fertility exhibits a nine month lag due to realization of gestation (assuming 40 weeks of gestation). That is, women who got pregnant after the law was passed, had access to abortion during their whole first trimester and are therefore considered as fully treated. Women who got pregnant 3 months before the law was passed, had at least some period of time when they could access the reform, and are therefore considered partially treated. The earliest time for which any impact on fertility can be detected would then be from October 2007 and onwards. Regarding maternal mortality, women conceiving after 24 January 2007 could access the reform at least some point during the first trimester while women conceiving after the reform was passed could access the reform during the whole first trimester. However, women conceiving before 24 January 2007, that is women pregnant beyond their first trimester at the time when the reform was passed, could have an illegal abortion during the remaining 6 months of their pregnancy and hence ``contaminate'' the maternal deaths taking place in the 6 months after the reform was passed. The fully exposed maternal deaths (without contamination) therefore occurs from 24 October and forward. Additionally, we also expect a lagged effect from maternal mortality since it is a function of fertility (i.e lower fertility implies lower mortality).

These are excluded from the sample. The dependent variables are defined as the number of maternal deaths.
